# Burger-HW

Burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!).

Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.

Whenever a user submits a burger's name, the app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.

Each burger in the waiting area and when the user clicks on a burger name on the left hand side, the burger will move to the right side of the page.

The app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

Node and MySQL query and route data in the app, and Handlebars generate the HTML.
